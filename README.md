Noted that I am ending up finishing a project that is different from what I submit in the project propasal. The following are the overall description of my project. 

# Problem Description
- The problem statement is sovling a navigation task that given a video of the observation of the trajectory, the robot will be able to navigate from its current position to the goal position.

- As the figure 1 shown below, the red point is the current position of the mobile robot and the blue point is the goal position. The green curve is a series of images in the video recorded from the camera of the mobile robot or other agents.
